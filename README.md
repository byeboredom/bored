### The Problem:

> New research reveals the average adult experiences 131 days of boredom a year. A new study of 2,000 people examined how frequently in adult life we experience days with no fun at all and found the typical respondent experiences more than a third of their year as boring, dreaded or specifically not fun days.

### Our goal:

> For you to not be bored.
